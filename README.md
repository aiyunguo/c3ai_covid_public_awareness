# c3ai_covid_public_awareness

#Our project aims to improve the coronavirus situation by influencing individual behavior. We understand that public health awareness campaigns play an important role in influencing peopleâ€™s behavior. At present, COVID-19 awareness campaigns are generic. We believe that targeted awareness campaigns based on insights on the levels of awareness of different social strata will be a game-changer. To gauge awareness levels from survey responses, we created an aggregated weighted score. We performed multivariate linear regression on this score. We found a negative correlation between the score and level of Trump support and a positive correlation between the score and age.
